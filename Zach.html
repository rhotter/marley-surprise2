                Good morning Marley,<br/><br/>There are three Marley's in this world: the people of Marley, Bob Marley (and his speakers), and Marley Xiong. Only one of them is an IMO silver medalist who went to McGill University, loves to travel for reasons outside of wanting to destroy the walls of Eldia, and is always high on a mysterious substance... oh wait, that's Bob, or is it??? Je vous souhaite a happy 2022-2016+18=24th birthday! By the way, I know you don't drink Tim Horton's coffee, but their Roll-up-the-rim (TM) is back, and I have a theory that you might find interesting. Since last year, their roll up the rim has been moved online. So instead of rolling up physical rims, you do the "roll up" on their app, which is basically a dice roll. My theory is that if you do the "roll" late at night (say 3am) when no one else is rolling, your odds of winning free coffees drastically shoots up. I've tested this on 20 rolls and I've gotten 10 coffees. I don't know statistics, so I don't know how to test this. Anyway, happy birthday! Hi Steve.<br/><br/>Best wishes,<br/>Zach
