    <p><h3>a birthday poem</h3><br/><br/>It's the birthday of Marley<br/>So we must create a rhyme<br/>It may be a little gnarly<br/>But that's how it be, sometimes<br/><br/>Such a curius person<br/>Will she figure out the brain?<br/>A fast and furious person<br/>There's no stopping this hype train<br/><br/>Putting her mind at work<br/>To find these neural links<br/>She's gonna solve it in a blink<br/>Btw is the brain even pink?<br/><br/>So much work and so many projects<br/>Must be quite a thrill<br/>She must be underwater<br/>But she never drowns<br/>Must have gone to Mc Gill</p>
